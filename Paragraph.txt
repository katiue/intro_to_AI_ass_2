if I'm happy then I win. If I win then You Loose. if you play then you have fun. If I have fun and you have fun then It's a good day.
If It's a good day and I dance then you dance. If you loose, you are broke. If you loose and I win then you play. You have fun.
I'm millionaire. I have fun. I'm happy. Am I happy?
